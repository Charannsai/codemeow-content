# üß† What is Coding?

**Coding**, also known as **programming**, is the process of giving step-by-step instructions to a computer in a language it understands. These instructions are used to **solve problems**, **perform tasks**, or **create software and applications**.

Think of coding as telling a computer *what to do*, *how to do it*, and *when to do it*‚Äîbut instead of using English, you use a **programming language**.

## ü§ñ Why is Coding Important?

- It's the **language of technology**‚Äîeverything from websites and mobile apps to self-driving cars and satellites runs on code.
- It allows us to **automate repetitive tasks**, saving time and effort.
- Coding helps solve real-world problems like health monitoring, financial forecasting, logistics, and more.
- It's a **creative skill**‚Äîyou can build games, bots, AI models, or even your own apps.

## üßæ Coding vs Programming

| Term            | Meaning |
|------------------|--------|
| **Coding**        | The act of writing instructions using a programming language. |
| **Programming**   | A broader concept involving logic, problem-solving, designing algorithms, and then implementing them via code. |
| **Scripting**     | Writing small programs (often for automation) that are interpreted line-by-line (e.g., Python, JavaScript). |
| **Developing**    | Encompasses planning, coding, testing, debugging, and deploying software. |

## üß© How Does Coding Work?

When you write code, you:

1. Write **instructions** using a syntax the language understands (like Python or Java).
2. The code is sent through a **compiler** (for compiled languages like C++) or an **interpreter** (for interpreted languages like Python).
3. The computer translates these instructions into **machine code** (binary: 0s and 1s).
4. The machine code is executed by the computer's CPU to perform the task.
